										<section class="section introduction">
										<p>Imagine trying to navigate rent, student loans, and everyday expenses without a clue where your money is going. This isn't a hypothetical scenario for many young adults ‚Äì it's their everyday reality.  A staggering 59% of young people are considered financially illiterate, a statistic that underscores the widespread struggle to manage money effectively.  This lack of financial knowledge can lead to accumulating debt, and difficulty saving for the future.  At the Athena Hackathon 2023, our team decided to tackle this challenge head-on.  Driven by a shared mission to empower young adults with financial understanding, we created CashSmart ‚Äì a mobile app designed to put financial literacy in the hands of the next generation.</p>

											<h2>The Development Process</h2>
											<!-- <p>üî® To maximize our workflow, all of our documentation was in Figma and shared Google Drive. We met regularly over Zoom and Discord to brainstorm on FigJam and to communicate the next steps in our process. We agreed on a timeline in which we would complete the project</p>
											<figure>
												<img src="images/project_timeline.png" alt="Project Timeline">
												<figcaption>Project timeline.</figcaption>
											</figure> -->
											<p>üó£ We began by conducting user research with 5 individuals who fit our audience criteria. In these interviews, we were able to understand and uncover the motivations, frustrations, and potential business and design opportunities from the participants.</p>
											<figure>
												<img src="images/user_interviews.png" alt="User Interviews">
												<figcaption>User Interviews.</figcaption>
											</figure>
											<p>üñå Based on our research insights, we conducted an affinity mapping exercise to identify key themes and brainstorm solutions to address the identified problems. For example, our user interviews revealed that many young adults struggled with understanding compound interest. This led us to create a dedicated module within CashSmart explaining the concept in simple terms, using real-world examples and interactive simulations.</p>

												<figcaption>Identifying user requirements through interview analysis.</figcaption>
											</figure>
											<p>üí≠Next, we brainstormed the brand image, deciding on the colors, shapes, and logos that would enhance the user experience. Additionally, we mapped out the user flow through the app to ensure that each feature was integrated in an intuitive and accessible manner.</p>

											</figure>
											<p>üé® We knew CashSmart needed to feel trustworthy and approachable, so we developed a comprehensive design system.  We chose a color palette of blues and greens to evoke a sense of calm and financial security. Our typography emphasizes clarity and readability.  One of our key design decisions was incorporating gamification, such as earning badges for completing modules and progress bars to visualize learning milestones. This was inspired by user feedback indicating a preference for interactive and engaging learning experiences.</p>
											<p>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Following our brainstorming session, we began the design process by wireframing our ideas in Figma. We started with low-fidelity wireframes to establish the overall structure and layout. As we progressed, we iteratively refined the wireframes and transitioned to high-fidelity designs. To expedite the development process and save time, we decided to prioritize the creation of clickable interactions directly on the high-fidelity prototype. This approach allowed us to swiftly validate and iterate on the user experience while maintaining a consistent and polished design throughout.</p>
										</section>
										<!-- <section class="section solution">
											<h2>So what did the final product look like?</h2>
											<p>The final product, CashSmart, emerged as a fully interactive and clickable mobile app prototype. It offers users a gamified learning environment to enhance financial literacy through engaging modules and video content. Within the app, users can set and track financial goals, monitor their personal finances, and make informed financial decisions. CashSmart also cultivates a supportive community, allowing users to connect, share insights, and support one another, making it not just a tool for financial management but a platform for collaborative growth and empowerment in financial well-being.</p>

											<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>
											<ul class="custom-bullets-challenges">
												<li>All five of us joined the hackathon virtually, so there was a learning curve with figuring out our workflow at the beginning.</li>
												<li>For most of the team it was their first time participating in a hackathon, and although that is a challenge, it is one we gladly took on to create something we are passionate about!</li>
												<li>We had varying levels of experience with Figma, which presented a great opportunity for team learning.  The more experienced members mentored those new to the platform, and we all benefited from the fresh perspectives.</li>

												<li>User Research with 5 individuals</li>

										<section class="section what-we-learned">
											<h2>What We Learned</h2>
											<p>Throughout our development of CashSmart, we learned how to create an app from the ground up using Figma. Our user interviews highlighted a significant demand for a platform that supports young people‚Äôs financial literacy in a personalized way. We found that many mainstream solutions were not meeting this need effectively due to a lack of inclusivity.

												In response, we developed CashSmart to offer a customizable experience where users can choose learning paths specifically tailored to their individual needs. Our application features straightforward videos that demystify complex financial concepts, accompanied by quizzes that help reinforce and apply what users learn. These elements are designed not only to educate but also to empower young people, enhancing their financial literacy and promoting inclusivity within the financial education space.</p>
